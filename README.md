# Sensor Data Repo

Sensor Data Repo is a website I created to store and display sensor data. A registered user can create Datasets, which represent collections of Sensors. For example, you might create a Dataset called "My Backyard Weather Station" to contain all of your weather station sensors: Thermometer, Barometer, Anemometer, and Rain Meter. Each sensor is identified by its name, type, and units of measure. Once created, a Sensor can be assigned various Measurements that may or may not be timestamped.

I created this site as a way to store and plot the sensor data from my robots so that I could (1) troubleshoot them more quickly
and (2) have a historical record of how the robots performed over time.

I also created this website to satisfy the requirements for the web development course I was taking in Fall 2015. Previous iterations of this project was a social networking site for robot hobbyists called Botspace. You can safely ignore those (labs 1 through 4).

Sensor Data repo isn't complete. However, I'm transplanting and expanding the code into another project: data-frame.
